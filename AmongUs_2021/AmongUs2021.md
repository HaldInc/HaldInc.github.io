# AmongUs 2021  

As the kids like **Among Us** and wanted their own emergency meeting bottom like the one from the game / cartoon:

You know, just in case they suspect someone in the apartment is a murder and need a meeting…   Anyway, the kids and I started to draw some sketches and I designed this in Fusion 360 according to the kid's specification. 

Time to start printing:


table {
  border: 1px solid red;
}
td {
  padding: 10px 0;
}
img {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  display: block
}

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Text
      <img src="InPrint.JPG" alt="drawing" width="50%"/>Text</td>
    <td>Text
      <img src="InPrint.JPG" alt="drawing" width="50%"/>Text</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Text
      <img src="InPrint.JPG" alt="drawing" width="50%"/>Text</td>
    <td>Text
      <img src="InPrint.JPG" alt="drawing" width="50%"/>Text</td>
  </tr>
</table>

It fulfills the kid’s specifications, but I am not too happy as the two parts can get stuck if you push it down too much off-center.

A bit of sanding fix it, but if I should ever redesign a large pushbutton, I would put the support closer to the edge. Not really a surprise, but another lesson learned. :)
