# Project:  Filament spool roller - June 2021

This is a small afternoon project to "upgrade" my Flashforge 3D printer, so I can swap the filament spool fast and easy and make sure it run nearly frictionless. The Flashforge design is working great out-of-the-box for their filament spools, but due to limited space, my printer is up agenst a wall and replacing spools is a pain. Therefore I always have two of my standard filaments installed here and pulled others from the side - if I need anything else.
