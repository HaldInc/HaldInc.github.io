# Jacob Hald - Projects
First of all, welcome to my little World on GitHub. This page serves mainly as my personal project build log, but as some people have asked me if I could share files and project info, I took the step and made a public page in 2021 (Covid-times). Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments.
