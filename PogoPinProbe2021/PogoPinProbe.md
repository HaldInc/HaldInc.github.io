# Pogo pin probe 2021

Yet another fast 3D printed project. For debugging an embedded design I am working on, I needed a very fine and slim probe. As I also had some pogo pins I designed a small holder so I can easily hold this onto the pin I need to measure.  

Material:  PLA    -  Print time: 15 min
